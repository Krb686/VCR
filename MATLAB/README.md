# MATLAB !! README #

Here's what you need to know to get up and running

### What is this repository for? ###

* MATLAB files - testing / simulation / etc.

### How do I get set up? ###

* First time git users - Read the following before doing anything else
    * [BitBucket 101](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101;jsessionid=20DAF13F46A40B656E362FA2BFFA5539.node3)
    * I recommend making a simple C++ or arduino (or whatever you're comfortable with) on your personal account to get familiar with how everything works.
* Create an account here at bitbucket
    * If the email address registered is different from the account that received the invite - email Dave to have that account added to the list of contributors for this repository.
* Download the GUI git project management software, 
* Clone the repository using SourceTree
    * Within SourceTree, enter your BitBucket login information (Tools > Options)
    * Hit the clone button in the top left & create a directory ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE
    * DO NOT SAVE OR EDIT WITHIN THE SHARED GOOGLE DRIVE FOLDER!

### Contribution guidelines ###

* All edits must be saved to the repository, the more commits you make, the better. 
* Commits made in SourceTree are only on your local machine until you hit the PUSH command. Others cannot see or evaluate anything until it is PUSHED to the repository.
* Be sure to learn about branching within the repository
    * Create a branch for any new function you are adding that may break parts others are working on
    * Once the part's operation is verified, Merge the branch back into the 'MASTER' branch

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Email Dave with any questions
